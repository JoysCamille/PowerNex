* *Please note that the current code is undergoing a major overhaul!*

PowerNex is a kernel written in the [[https://dlang.org][D Programming Language]].
The goal is to have a whole OS written in D, where PowerNex powers the core.

The name PowerNex comes from the words `power` and `next`. A kernel to power the
next generation of hardware.

* Building
It requires a crosscompiler, which can be aquired by running `./toolchainManager.d`.
PowerNex is using a build system called [[https://github.com/atilaneves/reggae][reggae]], which build scripts are
outputted in a [[https://ninja-build.org/][ninja]] format.

To enter the development environment run `source env.sh`.
This adds shortcuts for building and running.
- 'c' :: Removes the build files
- 'v' :: Compiles PowerNex
- 'b' :: Compiles and runs PowerNex in qemu
- 'a' :: Runs ~addr2line~ on the kernel

* System requirements
- A 64bit processor
- At least 128 MiB of ram (Probably work on less)

*Recommended & Supported Virtual Machines*
- QEMU
-- Recommended launch command ~qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom PowerNex.iso -m 128 -no-reboot~
- VirtualBox

* Thanks to
- Adam D. Ruppe - For his [[http://arsdnet.net/dcode/minimal.zip][minimal.zip]], which contains a bare bone minimal d runtime. Which this kernel is based on.
- Bloodmanovski - For his D Kernel [[https://github.com/Bloodmanovski/Trinix][Trinix]], His files for booting x64 really helped me a lot.
- Lukas "zrho" Heidemann - For his [[https://github.com/zrho/Hydrogen][Hydrogen]] project. It really inspired and help me to make PowerD, the intermediate bootloader.
