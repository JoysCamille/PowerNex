* *Please note that the current code is undergoing a major overhaul!*

PowerNex is a kernel written in the [[https://dlang.org][D Programming Language]].
The goal is to have a whole OS written in D, where PowerNex powers the core.

The name PowerNex comes from the words `power` and `next`. A kernel to power the
next generation of hardware.

* Building
It requires a crosscompiler, see link below for download.
It uses a build system called [[https://github.com/atilaneves/reggae][reggae]].

To enter the development environment run `source env.sh`.
This adds shortcuts for building and running.
- 'c' :: Removes the build files
- 'v' :: Compiles PowerNex
- 'b' :: Compiles and runs PowerNex in qemu
- 'a' :: Runs ~addr2line~ on the kernel

* Thanks to
- Adam D. Ruppe - For his [[http://arsdnet.net/dcode/minimal.zip][minimal.zip]], which contains a bare bone minimal d runtime. Which this kernel is based on.
- Bloodmanovski - For his D Kernel [[https://github.com/Bloodmanovski/Trinix][Trinix]], His files for booting x64 really helped me a lot.
